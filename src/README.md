Project 1: Tokenizer
====================

# Instructions:

This project builds a tokenizer, which is dividing a string into tokens, and maintains a history of those tokens. 

Based on the following methods in 'tokenizer.c', we were able to generate the array of tokens based on the user input.

A user can test the project by inputing a string of characters and the following methods will run and input:
 - Where the first word starts from the user input
 - Where the first word ends from the user input
 - The number of words that were inputted
 - All the words inputted tokenized
